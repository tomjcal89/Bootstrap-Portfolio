                            Hello! My name is Thomas I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. Some people refer to me as
                            the insurance guy.
                            I currently work at State Farm (and no, I do not wear khakis). I first got into insurance when
                            I moved to Austin, Texas
                            in 2015 where I started to work for Progressive (no, I don’t know Flo, but I did take a picture
                            with her cardboard cutout once).
                            Before I moved to Austin, I was a Customer Service Manager at Old Navy in Downtown San
                            Francisco. I did that for about 5 years, and let me tell you, retail is brutal.
                        </p>

                            Something unique about myself I would say is that I have a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do. Now, I got
                            it when I was 13 and haven’t
                            practiced it since I was 14, so I wouldn’t say I know much anymore. But, seeing how I do have a
                            blackbelt, its has always a fun
                            little fact to share with people.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            I have always been fascinated with coding and how it makes everything work. I was never able to
                            fully commit to learning it
                            because of my busy schedule. Now that I have the time, I am finally getting to do what I want
                            and I know it is going tom be
                            lifechanging. I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me.
                        </p>
