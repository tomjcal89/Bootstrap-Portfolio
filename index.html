    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome!</h1>
    <p class="lead">You may find just what you're looking for.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Hello! My name is Thomas I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. Some people refer to me as the insurance
      guy. I currently work at State Farm (and no, I do not wear khakis). I first got into insurance when I moved to
      Austin, Texas in 2015 where I started to work for Progressive (no, I don’t know Flo, but I did take a picture
      with her cardboard cutout once). Before I moved to Austin, I was a Customer Service Manager at Old Navy in
      Downtown San Francisco. I did that for about 5 years, and let me tell you, retail is brutal.</p>

    <p>Something unique about myself I would say is that I have a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do. Now, I got it when I was 13
      and haven’t practiced it since I was 14, so I wouldn’t say I know much anymore. But, seeing how I do have a
      blackbelt, its has always a fun little fact to share with people.</p>

    <p>I have always been fascinated with coding and how it makes everything work.
       I am ecstatic to be in this class and to finally get my hands dirty! There 
       have been a lot of moving parts on where I am today, and I can say this class is 
       the next step to get me where I want to be. Once I graduate from the boot camp, I 
       will be on the lookout for an industry and job switch to one in which I can showcase 
       my new skillsets. .</p>

      <p>This journey is going to be one wild rollercoaster ride and I cannot wait to see where it takes me!</p>
