        Hello! My name is Thomas I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. Some people refer to me as the insurance guy. 
        I currently work at State Farm (and no, I do not wear khakis). I first got into insurance when I moved to Austin, Texas 
        in 2015 where I started to work for Progressive (no, I don’t know Flo, but I did take a picture with her cardboard cutout once). 
        Before I moved to Austin, I was a Customer Service Manager at Old Navy in Downtown San Francisco. I did that for about 5 years, and let me tell you, retail is brutal.
</p>

        Something unique about myself I would say is that I have a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do. Now, I got it when I was 13 and haven’t 
        practiced it since I was 14, so I wouldn’t say I know much anymore. But, seeing how I do have a blackbelt, its has always a fun 
        little fact to share with people. 
    </p>

    <p>
            I have always been fascinated with coding and how it makes everything work. I was never able to fully commit to learning it 
            because of my busy schedule. Now that I have the time, I am finally getting to do what I want and I know it is going tom be 
            lifechanging. I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me. 
    </p>
